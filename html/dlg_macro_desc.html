          <h3>Death Check</h3>Whenever you would die, the Warden makes a <strong>Death Check</strong> for you. As soon as someone spends a turn checking your vitals, the result is revealed. If your character’s death is imminent, make your last moments count: save someone’s life, solve an important mystery, or give the others time to escape. Enjoy the carnage, then jump back in for more!
